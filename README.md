1) Rename files in PCB folder with proper names according to project.
	   Note: Altium project, schematic, and  pcb files should have same name.
	   There are some situations in more complex designs in which this is not the
	   case but for now follow this rule.
	   Example: Template.PcbDoc -> YourProjectName.PcbDoc
				Template.PrjPCB -> YourProjectName.PrjPCB
				Template.SchDoc -> YourProjectName.SchDoc
2) Populate Firmware folder with appropriate CCS/TrueStudio/Etc files.
3) Populate Document folder with appropriate documents files for project.
